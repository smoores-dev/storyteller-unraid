  <Overview>Storyteller is a self-hosted platform for creating and reading ebooks with guided narration. It's made up of two components: the alignment server, and the mobile apps. Together, these components allow you to take audiobooks and ebooks that you already own and automatically align them, as well as read or listen to (or both!) the resulting aligned books.&#xD;
&#xD;
Align your audiobooks and ebooks&#xD;
---------------------------------------&#xD;
Switch back and forth between listening and reading without losing your place, or have Storyteller read aloud to you while highlighting the text!&#xD;
&#xD;
Read or listen however you choose&#xD;
--------------------------------------&#xD;
Storyteller produces EPUB 3 compliant ebook files. You can read them with any ebook reader (software or hardware!) that supports EPUB Media Overlays, or you can use the dedicated Storyteller mobile apps.&#xD;
&#xD;
Own your books&#xD;
------------------&#xD;
Storyteller is completely self-hosted. All of your books stay on your hardware, and you're free to move, copy, and back them up as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
### AMD HW ACCELERATED TRANSCRIPTION:&#xD;
